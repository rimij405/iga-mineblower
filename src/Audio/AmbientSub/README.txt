Ambient Submarine Sounds
These sounds will be triggered randomly, one at a time and localized to the x location of the sub at the time the sound is triggered.  Sound files must be stereo to support panning.

The 4 placeholder sounds (all of which you need to replace) are:
Snd0.mp3: Creeeeeeak
Snd1.mp3: Clank
Snd2.mp3: Roger that (over an intercom)
Snd3.mp3: Pooooossshhhh

File SndGains.txt contains gain levels that will be applied to the sounds, one gain per line, in the same order as the sound files.
