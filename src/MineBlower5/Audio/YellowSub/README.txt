YellowSub uses a looping Horizontal Remixing object to accompany the background meander of the Yellow Submarine across the window from right to left.  Tracks 0-3 are a four-phrase sequence, where each track begins looping when the Yellow Submarine's x location passes another 1/4 of the distance across the window.  Track 4 is silence, which may be triggered when the sub gets far enough to the left of the window.

Replace these tracks with an interactive cue with some number of loopable sections (doesn't have to be four, but the last (extra) track must be silence.

Note: Since these tracks will loop, wav files are used instead of mp3s to insure seamless looping.
