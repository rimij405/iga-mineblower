This folder contains all the audio assets, with subfolders containing assets for objects of the specialized audio classes.

To replace a default asset without changing the code, simply replace its sound file with one of your own creation, using the same name.  You might want to save the placeholder somewhere...

Most of the specialized classes use multiple asset files, so these assets are grouped in subfolders with clever file names that differ only in a number, usually just before the extension ("mp3" or "wav").  In the code that loads the files, there will be a for loop like the following:

for (int i = 0; i < sndArray.length; i++)
{
  String filePath = "Sound" + i + ".mp3";    // Sound0.mp3, Sound1.mp3, etc.
  sndArray[i] = minim.loadFile(filePath, 512);
}

which assumes the file names differ only in the embedded number, which is the loop counter.  You'll get the idea when you look at the code in the loadAudio() method in the Audio object and the various constructors in the specialized classes.

Note: Some of the specialized classes will loop the individual sound files, in which case you should use wav files instead of mp3s. This is because the mp3 codec inserts 5 ms or so of silence at the beginning of each file as an artifact of the fft analysis needed for the perceptual compression. If you used wav files that loop cleanly in your DAW, they will loop cleanly in the game.
