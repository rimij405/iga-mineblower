Ominous Layers tracks used in a Vertical Remixing object to build an ominous chord tone by tone as the sub gets closer to the closest mine.  The chord in these placeholder sounds is a diminished 7th chord played on a muted trumpet.  The tracks start with OmLayer3.wav, which is the first one to be triggered, when the sub gets within the careful range.  Subsequent tracks pot up as the sub gets closer and closer.  If the mine is disarmed, the layers are replaced with the disarm music cue.  If the sub explodes the mine then the layers are replaced by the explosion cue.

OmLayerGains.txt contains the gain levels for each file that will be ramped up to or down from.

Note: wav files are used instead of mp3s to allow seamless looping.
