/* Simple crossfade class - by Al Biles
 Implements a simple crossfade between tracks stored in an array
 of AudioPlayers.  Actually a simple variant on the HorReSeq class
 that immediately does a crossfade from the currently playing track
 to the new track by fading out the current track while starting
 and fading in the new track.  Each track is looped when it is playing.
 The duck() and restore() methods can be used to fade out entirely
 and fade back in while remaining on the current track.
 
 Methods:
 xFade() - Fades out the currently playing track (if any) while fading in
    the indicated track.  If the current track is ducked, changes the
    current track to the new one, but leaves it ducked.
 duck() - Quickly ducks (fades out the level of) the currently playing track
    without stopping it.
 restore() - Quickly fades the level of the currently ducked track to
    its level in the gains array.

  float [] gains;        // Gain levels for each track (0.0 => play as is)
  float [] leng;         // Length of each track in ms (not used currently)
  int currTrk = -1;      // Offset in array of currently playing sound
  int nextTrk = -1;      // Offset of next track to play (-1 => none)
  int fadeTime = 500;    // Crossfades will take this many milliseconds
  float silent = -70.0;  // Inaudible gain level
  boolean ducked = false;

  // Constructor needs path & number of sound files
  // The dirPath should be a folder name followed by a slash followed
  // by a root file name.  For example if you have Tune0.mp3, Tune1.mp3
  // and Tune2.mp3 in the BackMus folder, you would pass in
  // "BackMus/Tune" as the value of dirPath, and nSnds would be 3.
  // Also expects a Gain file containing gain levels for the sound files,
  // one per line.  These will be used to set the max gain for each file
  // when it is faded in.  The Gain file in this example would be named
  // TuneGain.txt, in the BackMus folder.
  //
  // Parameter ext could be any legal file extension supported by minim,
  // but the 3 most common are: "wav", "aiff", and "mp3".
  // Because mp3 files often have added silence at the beginning and/or
  // end of the file, which stems from the windowing done in the Fourier
  // analysis needed for the perceptual incoding, they may introduce
  // noticable delays that can prevent precise looping and seamless
  // beat-level transitions between stems.  While the transitions
  // should not be a problem for this class because the stems are
  // crossfaded, it may be a problem when a stem loops. If so, 
  // then use wav or aiff files instead of mp3 files for the stems.
